   Highlight Detection in Soccer Video
  </h2>
  <div class="project">
            <div class="projectcontent">
                <h4 style="margin-top:0">Objective</h4>
                <p>We propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for soccer video highlight detection. The proposed framework includes some new low-level soccer video processing algorithms, such as shot boundary detection, grass color region detection, view type classification, and play position classification, as well as several higher-level algorithms for slow-motion replay detection, score change detection and goal event detection.The system can output two types of summaries: i) all slow-motion replay segments in a game, ii) all goals in a game.</p>
                <h4>Overview and Challenges</h4>
                <p>With the rapid development of multimedia production and transmission technology, how to more effectively, more accurately analyze a large scale of sports video data and extract sports video summarization according to users preferences is becoming a meaningful and challenging topic. Besides, how to computationally efficient and robust is anther challenge we faced with. </p>
                <h4>The Journey</h4>
                <p> This project lasted more than half year of my senior and was chosen as my undergraduation project and bachelor thesis. The whole system and its demo project are designed and developed by myself.
                In general, highlight in a soccer video are the special events that audiences are especially interested in, e.g. goals, shoots, fouls, corner-kicks and free kicks etc. Among all the events above, slow-motion replay and goal events weigh most. In this paper, we propose a novel soccer video processing framework that could not only satisfy these requirements but also very effectively and accurately detect replay, goal events and deliver a soccer video summarization to users.

   MSR-Bing Image Retrieval Challenge 2013
  </h2>
  <div class="project">
            <div class="projectcontent">
                <h4 style="margin-top:0">Objective</h4>
                <p>This study addresses approaches for MSR-Bing Image Retrieval Challenge to assess the relevance on a pair of query term and image. Our approaches aim to boost the performance of web scale image retrieval, where images in the initial list (indexed by query term) can be re-ranked based on their relevances. One year BING image retrieval logs are used to develop the relevance assessment system. Several visual features are employed to describe one image. A visual similarity learning algorithm is introduced to train a weighted image similarity.</p>
                <h4>Overview and Challenges</h4>
                <p>Traditional solutions is training a set of classifiers for different topics and assessing the relevance by the classifier related to a specific query term. It is hard to scale up when dealing with a huge amount of concepts. Training a classifier for each topic is impractical. A retrieval-based method is proposed to handle this problem.</p>
